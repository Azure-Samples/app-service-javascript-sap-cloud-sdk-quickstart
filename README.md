* OData v2 and v4 + entity and client generator managed by SAP
* OpenAPI + client generator managed by SAP

## Getting Started üõ´

### Prerequisites & Installation

Follow the [SAP Cloud SDK documentation for JavaScript](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/tutorials/getting-started/introduction) for your project setup.

Use either

* SAP's [mock server](https://sap.github.io/cloud-s4-sdk-book/pages/mock-odata.html),
* SAP's [public demo system ES5](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/gateway-demo-signup.html),
* [SAP Cloud Appliance Library](https://cal.sap.com/) or
* your own available SAP system.

> **Note**
> Be aware that SAP's mock server is anticipating the S4 Cloud version of the Business Partner API. So, you might need to adapt the mock server to your needs. During our testing at the time of release there were no discrepancies discovered.

[![GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=576207479) to hit the ground running with our tailored image and avoid installing anything on your local machine and continue with step 6.

### Quickstart üöÄ

0. Familiarize yourself with the [SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript developer tutorial](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/tutorials/getting-started/introduction)
1. git clone [repository clone url](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-javascript-sap-cloud-sdk-quickstart.git)
2. cd app-service-javascript-sap-cloud-sdk-quickstart
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run start:dev`
5. browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) for your "hello world"
6. maintain your SAP OData url with credentials in [.env](templates/.env) file (put in project root) and restart the app if necessary
7. browse to [http://localhost:8080/business-partner](http://localhost:8080/business-partner) for your first OData call and pick one of the business partners (examples below use ids from SAP mock server)

> **Note**
> SAP's examples for the business partner API for S4 Cloud mentioned in the tutorial **differ** to the S4 on-premises flavor. Add AddressUsage, otherwise you will see "Internal error when calling operation module BUA_CHECK_ADDRESS_VALIDITY_ALL; a check table is missing". Check SAP KBA's for more details.

8. get that business partner by id: [http://localhost:8080/business-partner/1003764](http://localhost:8080/business-partner/1003764)

![screenshot of successful business partner retrieval by id](img/bupa-get-postman.png)

9. update the address with a house number: [http://localhost:8080/business-partner/1003764/address/28238](http://localhost:8080/business-partner/1003764/address/28238)

![screenshot of business partner address update with request details](img/bupa-update-postman.png)

10. delete the address: [http://localhost:8080/business-partner/1003764/address/28238](http://localhost:8080/business-partner/1003764/address/28238)

![screenshot of business partner address delete](img/bupa-delete-postman.png)

11. add an address to your chosen business partner: [http://localhost:8080/business-partner/1003764/address](http://localhost:8080/business-partner/1003764/address)

Congratulationsü•≥, you have successfully consumed SAP OData with the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript running on Azure App Service!

## Deploy to Azure ü™Ç

There are multiple ways to deploy this project to Azure. In this example we use the [Azure App Service extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice) for VS Code to deploy the project. Learn more about [this process on Microsoft learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/create-publish-webapp-app-service-vs-code/5-exercise-publish-app-azure-app-service-vs-code?pivots=nodeexpress)

1. Create an Azure App Service with Node.js 18 LTS and Linux using the [VS Code extension for Azure](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/extensions) or use below button
2. Maintain environment variables in the [Azure App Service configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/configure-common?tabs=portal#configure-app-settings) - just like you did for the `.env` file for local execution in the previous section
3. Deploy to Web App from VS Code or GitHub Codespaces (right click in the explorer on the project folder and select "Deploy to Web App...")
4. Browse your new app powered by the SAP Cloud SDK (it takes a while the first time)

## Authentication with Azure AD üîê

[Configure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad) your App Service or Azure Functions app to use Azure AD login. Use standard variable `X-MS-TOKEN-AAD-ACCESS-TOKEN` to retrieve the access token from the request header. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-oauth-tokens#retrieve-tokens-in-app-code)

Consider SAP Principal Propagation for your authentication scenario. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/sap-api#production-considerations)

## Connectivity to SAP backends and secure virtual network access üîå

SAP backends on Azure typically run in fully isolated virtual networks. There are multiple ways to connect to them. Most popular ones are:

* Integrate your App Service with an Azure virtual network (VNet). [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/configure-vnet-integration-enable).
* Private Endpoints for Azure App Service. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/networking/private-endpoint?source=recommendations)
* User Azure API Management for OData with SAP Principal Propagation. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/sap-api#production-considerations)

VNet integration enables your app to securely access resources in your VNet, such as your SAP Gateway, but doesn't block public access to your App Service. To achieve full private connectivity for the app service too, look into private endpoints.

## DevOps üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª

* Consider activating GitHub Actions for your Azure project for out-of-the-box integrated CI/CD flows. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions?tabs=applevel)
* Explore cloud-native zero-downtime deployment styles like "[blue-green](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/example-scenario/blue-green-spring/blue-green-spring)" with Azure App Service deployment slots. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-staging-slots)

## Troubleshooting ü©∫
